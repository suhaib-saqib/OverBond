# OverBond

## How To Use:

- Download files into one folder
- double click 'overbond.html' to open in browser of choice
- open browser console to see information

## Overview:

- This app calculates the yield spread for a bond using a benchmark government bond or the government bond curve.
- Currently stores the required bonds for challenge 1 and 2 as an array of objects, the only way to currently test with new bonds is to change those values
- This app only uses javascript since javascript is incredibly versatile
- I tried to reuse as much code as possible by breaking things down into functions. For example the separateBonds() function comes in handy repeatedly

## Potential Future Improvements:

- Allow inputting of bonds using HTML form
- Allow inputting of bonds directly from csv file
- Allow user to choose spread to benchmark or spread to curve
- Display results using reactive front-end instead of console
